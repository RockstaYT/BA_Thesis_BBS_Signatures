## Blind Sigantures

In the Blind Signatures Draft, there is a signer_blind value.
That value is used by the issuer to blind the commitment, in case that the same commitment is used more than once.

## Malicous holder in Link Secrets

It is not possible for a Malicous Holder with power over the random value generator to forge a link between to VCs.

Reason for that is, that the random values are used to calculate the challenge.

If the forged random value is not passed into the challenge calculation, then the challenge will not match to the one the verifier calculates.
If the forged random value is passed to the challenge calculation, then the the random value chosen will result in a different masked message as the challenge returns an other value as expected (as the malicious random value given to the challenge calculation results in an different challenge).
