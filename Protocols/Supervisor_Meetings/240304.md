## IDs in VCs

There are 2 Places were Ids are in VCs:
1. The ID of the VC. This is a unique ID to the VC to make it recognizable.
2. The ID of the Subject which the VC is about (must of the time about the holder)

These VCs are not mandatory, but the ID of the VC could be used to revoke the VC (but is sadly a link).
But with ZKP it may be possible to break the link and just say that the ID is not part of the revocation list.
