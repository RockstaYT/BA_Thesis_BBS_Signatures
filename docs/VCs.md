https://w3c.github.io/vc-specs-dir/

can issuer be something else?
Like public Key?

DIDs?

ID
Signer Sends VC to holder (also the signature)

Maybe like this:

{
    sig:
    msgs: {}
}

holder then sends data to verifier
but it was a new VC

4.11.2 doest say much :(

5.8 Verifier needs to say what he wants
"t is also possible for the verifier to provide a schema to the holder as part of a request for the holder's data"
