# Risks

* Sickness me/supervisor
* Project plan is bad
* other Ideas


This file will be part of the project management document.

## VCs

1. There is the possibility that the structure of VCs breaks the unlinkability of BBS. If that is the case, the stucture of VCs needs to be reworked so there is no linkability. Possiblity: Low

## OIDC4VC

1. There is the possibility that the implementation of OIDC4VC leaks data. If that is the case, the structure of the OIDC4VC protocol needs to be reworked so there are no more data leaks. Possibility: Low

2. There is the possibility that the implementation of OIDC4VC breaks the unlinkability of BBS. If that is the case, the structure of the OIDC4VC protocol needs to be reworked so there is no linkability. Possibility: Medium

## Psuedonyms

1. There is the possibility that the implementation of Pseudonyms breaks the unlinkability of BBS. If that is the case, the structure of Pseudonyms needs to be reworked so there is no linkability. Possibility: Low

## Blind Signatures

1. 

## Link Secrets

1. There is the possibility that the implementation of Link Secrets breaks the unlinkability of BBS. If that is the case, the implementation of the Link Secrets needs to be reworked so there is no linkability. Possibility: Middle

2. There is the possibility that the implementation of Link Secrets allows the holder of multiple VCs to Link the together on a different Secret. If that is the case, the implemetation of the Link Secrets needs to be reworked so that this os no longer possible: Possibility: High
